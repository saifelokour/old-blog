I've been unfortunate enough to study in more than one educational institution. Some were better than others, but it's almost always the case that the amount of enjoyment I have when I learn depends on the teacher, not the curriculum. Why is that? Why does the bulk of the educational process forced onto the shoulders of educators? Because it's their job? Sure you could argue that. But not every teacher is a miracle worker. All of them are faced with the impossible task of making a unreasnablly boring curriculum interesting and engaging for their students. I don't envy them.

I love learning, and I love to teach. I enjoy the challenge of trying to grasp a new idea, and I'm captivated by the look on your face when I manage to explain something to you. But it's easy when it's just one idea. It's a comepletely different story when we're talking about teaching curriculums. 

And that's just it. Stories. Human beings are storytellers. So why are we trying so hard to force people to learn outside of their natural way of processing information. It's as if being modern means throwing away what makes us human.

I don't want this to end up just me complaining about the terrible state of the current educational institutions. Instead I want to explore what it might be like to restructure the way we teach so that it comes as naturally as when your friends tells you what happened to them when they went to the movies last night.
